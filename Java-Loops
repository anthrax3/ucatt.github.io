				<h1>Java Loops</h1>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. This repeated executions can be handled using loop structures.<br />
<h2>while loop</h2>Repeats a block of statements while a given condition is true. Tests condition before executing the loop body.<br />
<h2>for loop</h2>Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.<br />
Here is an enhanced for loop..<br />
<code>for(declaration : expression) {<br />
   // Statements<br />
}</code><div class="pad">Declaration - The newly declared block variable, is of a type compatible with the elements of the array you are accessing. The variable will be available within the for block and its value would be the same as the current array element.<br>Expression - This evaluates to the array you need to loop through. The expression can be an array variable or method call that returns an array.</div><br />
<pre><br />
public class Test {<br />
   public static void main(String args[]) {<br />
      int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};<br />
      for(int x : numbers ) {<br />
         System.out.print( x );<br />
         System.out.print(",");<br />
      }<br />
      System.out.print("\n");<br />
      String [] names = {"James", "Larry", "Tom", "Lacy"};<br />
      for( String name : names ) {<br />
         System.out.print( name );<br />
         System.out.print(",");<br />
      }<br />
   }<br />
}<br />
</pre>The output is:<br />
<pre><br />
10, 20, 30, 40, 50,<br />
James, Larry, Tom, Lacy,<br />
</pre><h2>do..while loop</h2>Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.<br />
<h2>Loop control statements</h2>They are used to change the normal execution of the loop.<br />
<b>break statement</b><br />
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.<br />
<b>continue statement</b><br />
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
